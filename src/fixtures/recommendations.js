			'Although mild drinking of alcohol (one standard drink or less per day) is associated with a lower risk of stroke, regular drinking of alcohol exceeding this level (alcohol excess), binge drinking (drinking lots of alcohol at once, for example, 75 or more grams of pure ethanol [approximately one 750 ml bottle wine or 200 ml spirits] for a 24-hour period once a month or more frequently) or alcoholism, increases the risk of stroke significantly by increasing blood pressure.      A ‘standard drink’ is one that contains 10 grams of pure alcohol (ethanol). To calculate how much alcohol is consumed, it is important to know the amount of alcohol per drink.       One standard drink of alcohol a day is approximately equivalent to:      1 can (340 ml) of regular 3.5% alcohol beer/lager      200 ml of 5% alcohol beer/lager      1 glass (140 ml) of 10% alcohol table wine      1 small glass (80 ml) of 17.5% alcohol fortified wine/sherry      1 shot (40 ml) of spirits (40% alcohol)      Mild drinking of alcohol increases blood pressure and should be avoided by people with elevated blood pressure (hypertension). Some blood pressure lowering drugs are also incompatible with alcohol and can result in medical complications.       If you need assistance in reducing or quitting alcohol intake, setting up a goal and cutting back gradually over a realistic period of time (week, month) or seeking support from support groups and alternative treatments (e.g. acupuncture, counselling) can help you to reduce alcohol drinking.       Recreational drug use      Heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine, marijuana and other recreational drugs may produce stroke due to inflammation of arteries and veins, spasm of brain arteries, heart dysfunction (including irregular heart beats), increased blood clotting, or sudden increase of blood pressure. Stopping recreational drug use may prevent stroke in many young adults.',

			'Moderately elevated blood pressure      If you have been diagnosed with hypertension (elevated blood pressure), it is important to see a doctor regularly and follow the recommendations the doctor gives to control your blood pressure. The scope and intensity of these recommendations depend on the severity (level) and duration of the hypertension and other associated conditions (e.g. other diseases).       The lower your blood pressure, the lower is your risk of stroke (either primary or recurrent stroke). Each 10 mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure will reduce your risk of having a stroke by approximately one-third. The usually recommended target for blood pressure reduction is blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (in people with diabetes, below 130/80 mm Hg).       As you have moderately high systolic blood pressure (between 140 and 179 mm Hg), you are likely to require regular blood pressure reducing medications, as determined by your doctor. It is important to remember that once blood pressure medication is started it should not be stopped abruptly, as this can cause a rapid increase of blood pressure that can lead to stroke or myocardial infarction.       - Blood pressure lowering medication       There are five main types of blood pressure lowering (antihypertensive) drugs:      Diuretics (e.g. bendrofluazide)      Beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol) and alpha-blockers (e.g. labetalol)      Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. perindopril, captopril, quinapril, enalapril, ramipril)      Angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (e.g. telmisartan, candesartan)      Calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem, felodipine)      Modern antihypertensive drugs have been proven to be safe and have few side effects. However, if you notice any side effects (such as nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, cough etc.), a doctor’s advice should be sought. If the cause of the symptom(s) is related to blood pressure lowering medication, the doctor may recommend changing the dosage or trying an alternative drug that doesn’t cause the same side effects.       - Lifestyle changes       It is important to know that beneficial effects of blood pressure lowering treatment are always enhanced by healthy lifestyle changes, and vice versa.      Losing some weight: On average, every kilogram of weight loss can result in the reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of about 1.1-1.6 mm Hg. see ’Maintaining healthy weight’.      Salt intake reduction: A simple reduction of salt intake by only 2 g a day would result in systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction of approximately 4 mm Hg systolic and 2 mm Hg diastolic. See &amp;apos;Unhealthy diet&amp;apos;.      Altering the diet - See &amp;apos;Unhealthy diet&amp;apos;.      Increasing exercise level - See &amp;apos;Sedentary lifestyle&amp;apos;.      Stopping smoking or reducing exposure to passive smoking - See &amp;apos;Smoking&amp;apos;.      Two healthy lifestyle modifications are particularly important to reduce blood pressure: salt intake reduction and weight loss.',

			'Diabetes mellitus      Diabetes mellitus (elevated blood sugar) increases the chance of having a stroke by causing changes in the vascular system (blood vessels, heart) and promoting atherosclerosis. There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 usually starts at a young age and requires regular injections of insulin (so-called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Type 2 mainly occurs in people over 40 and can usually be controlled by diet and anti-diabetic tablets in the initial stages.       People with diabetes should try to keep their blood sugar level under control and make sure that all aspects of their health are also carefully controlled to prevent stroke. This can be managed by:      Regularly taking prescribed medication.      Regularly checking and monitoring blood sugar levels (for most people, ideal levels are 3-6 mmol/L before meals and 3-8 mmol/L two hours after meal). Follow your doctor’s advice.      A balanced diet.      Maintaining weight through regular physical activities.',
